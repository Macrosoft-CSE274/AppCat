# this is a list of tests we gonna implements
# in order to test the reliability of our app
# the web based app

--------white box test---------

1. Search an app in the search box and see if that cab return a result page
   and click into the result of an specific and see if that can go to the
   detail page of that app

2. Let an register user to submit an application for app adding
   and see if the administrator can see the application and approve/disapporve
   the app and give feedback
   and finalyy see if the user can know whether their application is approved and
   if they can see the feedback from the administartor

3. Register an user and see if this register user can login as expected

4. try the search button at every page or after a lot of operation done
   see whether the search can work.


---------grey box test---------

1. input the different weblink in the browser
   and see if the client can response as expected
   do the response as they should do, this gonna test the
   regular expression mecahnism for recognizing the weblinks.

2. When add user, add comment and add app
   see if the database do the right operation
   is there a significant lack of efficiency?
   do we properly close the database after we use that?

3. When people doing different kind of operation on the website
   see if the server receive the rigth request form as expected
   (the GET  or   POST  form)

4. We user try to add a comment to an app
   See if how the comment is process?
   how the app comment is added to app and to the database?
   Is there any way make this comment can be retrieved without getting another comment?


---------Black box test--------------

1. check how the seach function work in this app
   when user submit a keyword, how the backend process the this keyword
   how it compare to the existed apps' name and how to judge the equality
   Is all the way as exepcted? Is all the way proper enough
   (from security and efficiency prespective) ?

2. when user request a webpage, we can check how the server get the response
   and render the custom webpage for the user? Is different custom requirement from
   user are satisfied? Is this process efficiency enough? Is there any operation
   during this process will cause potential harm to the system? Is this webpage can
   work well when user get it?

3. When user do operation on the webpage
   we will check how the data from user is processed
   how each lines of code treat user's data?
   Is the logic of code is proper and right?
   how the server will response when exception happen?
   Can the server reduce the risk to minimum then the exception happen?
